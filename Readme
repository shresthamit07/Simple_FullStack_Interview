First, unzip the project

1. How to run the project?

	I assume that Ruby has been properly installed in your computer. I used Sinatra, which is a light-weight web framework for Ruby, to build this application.

	i. Go to the project directory
	ii. Install gem Sinatra.
		> gem install Sinatra
	iii. Once the sinatra is installed, just run the app.rb file. (*Note: Make sure that you are in the project directory)
		> ruby app.rb

	iv. visit http://localhost:4567

2. How to run the test?
	I used Rspec to test this application. So, a rspec gem need to be installed in your computer.

	i. Go to the project directory
	ii. Install rspec gem
		> gem install rspec
	iii. Type following command to run the test
		> rspec spec/app_spec.rb

3. Implementation
	> I used Ruby to develop this application and sinatra as a web framework. 
	> "App.rb" is the main file with all the routes and methods to interact with the interface.
	> "index.erb" is a file inside views directory, which is the front end design of the application.
	> I created public folder and put all the given input files in it, so that it is accessible in the application.
	> style.css and fullstack-min.js are the css and javascript files for the project.
	> I have created a spec folder to include the app_spec.rb which includes the code for testing the application.

	> I used bootstrap, which is an open source css framework, to build the better design of the application.
	> For designing the html table with sorting functionality, I used jquery dataTable plugin which is an open 	source jquery plugin for better table functionality.

	Note: As I have used the online cdn link to integrate the bootstrap and jquery dataTable, you need to have internet connection to see the effect of those plugins.
	for eg. <script src="https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.15/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js"></script> has been used for jQuery dataTable. 

4. Comments
	Overall it is interesting to build this application as a Full Stack Coding Challenge. I used my experience to build the application.
